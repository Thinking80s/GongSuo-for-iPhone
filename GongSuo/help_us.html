            <h3> The main symptoms of : </h3>
            <p> To date, only accompanied by pain of contractions, is a precursor to childbirth. Began to labor pain and some mothers are in the abdomen, and some mothers feel at the waist. You don't be nervous, frightened by pains. In fact, not strong contractions can not feel or during menstruation, abdominal pain as. Pain intensity also differ from man to man. When the contractions induced by you mild pain, while in the past, the pain gradually strengthened, to shorten the interval, prolonged pain. Uterine like the waves came to the lower abdomen, pain or backache of diffusion, defecate feeling, this contraction is for the baby was born ready. So this wasn't what pain, if cooperate with the doctor, use you practiced breathing exercise combined with uterine contraction, can smoothly through the delivery shut. Please remember Dr. Reed this sentence &quot;maternal stress, palace mouth contracture; maternal relax, Miyaguchi Matsu. &quot;I hope it can come with you to the successful completion of the task. </p>
            <h3> manifestation: </h3>
            <p> Weeks before the delivery, the more sensitive the uterine muscle, there will be irregular uterine contraction, of short duration, weak, or only the lower part of uterus. After a few hours and then stop, can make cervix mouth opening, therefore not in labor, called false labor. While in labor contractions of the uterus, is rules of. At the beginning of the interval time is about 10 minutes at a time, women feel abdominal pain, then pain gradually extend the duration to 40 seconds ~60 seconds. The degree of increase, the interval time is shortened, about 3~5 minutes. When the contraction of the uterus abdominal pain, feel abdomen is very hard. </p>
            <h3> pseudo contractions: </h3>
            <p> Pseudo contractions are called persistent contractions, is an occasional uterine contraction. It is characterized by no rules appearing time, the degree of the strong and weak. Pseudo contractions in the 6 week of pregnancy, it has already begun, until after mid pregnancy began to feel. Union of Obstetrics and gynecology doctors say, late pregnancy often touched the stomach will cause false contractions lead to premature delivery. </p>
            <h3> Uterine atony: </h3>
            <p> Uterine inertia refers to the contraction of the uterus still maintained normal rhythm, symmetry and polarity, but the strength of uterine contraction decreased, resulting in contraction interval is prolonged, shortens the duration of each contraction force, when palace mouth weak, slow expansion, enable the delivery time prolonged, the fetus is threatened, maternal terribly fatigued. Palace mouth did not open, resulting in the birth process delay, cause fetal head into the pelvis, bladder oppression between the fetal head and the pubic symphysis, dysuria, urinary retention; effect of placenta from the uterine wall peeling, lead to postpartum hemorrhage; increase fetal intrauterine hypoxia and trauma opportunity. Prompt. If the woman is caused by the tension and fear of childbirth uterine atony, quasi father and family to be patient persuasion, to relax, to ultimately make normal delivery. </p>
            <h3> uterine contraction: </h3>
            <p> Is uterine contraction, uterine contraction, is the main force of labor. Throughout the whole process of childbirth through; auxiliary force is the diaphragm and abdominal muscle, levator ani muscle contraction force, appeared only in second, the three stage of labor, the main role collaborative. That is to say, the contraction is the impetus of childbirth. </p>
            <h3> note: </h3>
            <p> In about a month before delivery, uterine contraction began. Some people just started when no feeling, only hand to touch the belly, will feel the contraction, and the pregnant mother will feel the contraction frequency more and more high. The general computing contractions per hour, if the number of contractions in the 10 or so it belongs to the relatively frequent, should go to a hospital in time, take some tocolytic drugs under the guidance of a doctor, to prevent premature. If the number of contractions is not very frequent, no abdominal pain, pay attention to rest on it. Need to pay attention, do not use drug by oneself, then and taking drugs generally also cannot alleviate,, the pregnant mother should pay attention to rest, especially not to stimulate the stomach. If the contractions stronger, accompanied by abdominal pain, for example, the pain to be on tenterhooks, work and life are affected, you need to go to hospital. </p>
            <h3> mitigation Methods: </h3>
            <p> First, procumbent, eyes closed, with the nose deep breathing Second, to the mouth of a deep breath to relax the abdomen Third, to nasal breathing, breath holding, and then a long breath. </p>
            <h3> Methods of prevention: </h3>
            <p> First, don't go too much distance and moving heavy objects. Walk too much light on the maternal fetal weight is a great burden in addition, holding the weight can cause abdominal force, it is easy to cause contractions. Second, tired to lie down to rest, keep quiet, will be very effective. Third, do not pressure build up. Mental fatigue and physical fatigue will lead to all kinds of problems, pressure buildup is vulnerable to the abdomen harden, best can do to relax. Fourth, prevent catch a cold.
